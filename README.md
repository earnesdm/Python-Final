# Checkers AI
Contains a checkers game I made. Checkers3.0.py will let you play against an AI based on the Minimax algorithm. The agent searches 6 moves ahead. Boards are scored by counting pieces with standard pieces assigned a value of +1 and king assigned a value of +3; enemy pieces have negative values. 

I might add Alpha-Beta Prunning to this soonish.

You need Pygame and Python 3.7 to run this. Just run the file Checkers3.0.py to play.
