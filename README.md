# Checkers AI
Contains a checkers game I made. Checkers3.0.py will let you play against an AI based on the Minimax algorithm. The agent searches 6 moves ahead. Boards are scored by counting pieces with standard pieces assigned a value of +1 and king assigned a value of +3; enemy pieces have negative values. 

I might add Alpha-Beta Prunning to this soonish.

You need Pygame 2.5.2 and Python 3.8 to run this. 

Just run the file Checkers3.0.py to play. Move a piece by clicking on it with your mouse and then selecting the square to jump to. Remember that if it is possible for you to jump the opponents piece then you have jump.
